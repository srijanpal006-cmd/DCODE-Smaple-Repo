# What is DCODE?
DCODE is an open-source development initiative by Dev Club aimed at encouraging students to explore and actively contribute to real-world open-source projects. It provides an environment for students to learn through industry level code, work with other people and solve real problems while also giving back to the community. DCODE creates an environment where participants can contribute meaningfully and perhaps become the maintainer of a project. 
DCODE will also serve as a platform for users to showcase and improve their technical skills and ability to work with others.

# Vision of DCODE
DCODE will be a community of Developers and students who will be fueling major Open source projects and create a strong culture of OSS in India. And the graduates of the program will heavily contribute to and maybe even become the maintainers of major projects.
